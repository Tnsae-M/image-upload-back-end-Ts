High-priority fixes (do these first)

Fix error handler flow (currently falls through and always returns 500 even for AppError).
Normalize naming/casing: filenames, model names, and schema fields (e.g., publish_Date → publishDate or publish_date) to avoid silent Mongoose ignores.
Add validation (Joi/Zod/express-validator) for request bodies and query params.
Move business logic out of controllers into services (keep controllers thin).
Enable safe updates: use { new: true, runValidators: true, context: "query" } and handle null returns from findByIdAndUpdate.
