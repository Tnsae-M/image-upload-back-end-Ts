Method 1: VS Code GUI (easiest for beginners)
Open Source Control panel (Ctrl+Shift+G or click the branch icon in sidebar)

Stage changes: Click the + next to each file, or + all at top

Commit: Type a short message like "Add signIn controller" in the box, press Ctrl+Enter

Push: Click the sync arrows in bottom status bar, or ... → "Push"

Method 2: Terminal (faster once comfortable):
# Stage all changes
git add .

# Commit with message
git commit -m "Add signIn controller with bcrypt compare"

# Push to GitHub
git push
